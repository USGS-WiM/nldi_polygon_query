## Overview

Provide an overview paragraph of how science is used in the project. Example: StreamStats provides regional regression equations to estimate peak-flow discharge based on basin characteristics, stream active-channel width, stream bankfull width, or stream width measured from aerial photos. The peak-flow discharge values from any combination of these four types of equations can be weighted together to produce weighted peak-flow discharge values. The SIR 2020-5142 report describes how to weight these values together. This project implements those values to weight the values together so they can be printed in a StreamStats report.

## Scientific Workflow

1. In this section, describe the steps to reproduce the scientific workflow.
2. Describe how input data is provided, when equations are used, how output data is provided, etc.
3. Reference specific equations, map services, fields, tables, charts, etc. as applicable.
